### 1.1.      Slide Design

To be consistent with the organisational brand, all presentations to disseminate statistics must use the approved Ghana Statistical Service PowerPoint template. The design for the title and content slides are shown below:

### 1.2.      Outline of Presentations

The recommended outline for presentations for disseminating results is provided below:

·         Background – provides information on the relevance of the report.

·         Key Concepts – provides definitions of concepts required to understand the findings.

·         Data Sources and Methodology – provides an overview of the data and methodology.

·         Findings – presents the findings in charts. In the outline section, the findings should be subdivided into categories to guide the audience on what to expect.

·         Key Takeaways - delivers  summary of the main stories from the findings. The recommended number of takeaways is five.

An example of a presentation outline is provided below:

The penultimate slide of the presentation should provide information on where the report and any other relevant resources can be accessed – with the link to the GSS website, or short URL and QR code that link directly to report.

In instances where a short URL is used, the link the main Ghana Statistical Service website ([https://statsghana.gov.gh/](https://statsghana.gov.gh/)) should also be provided.

If the report is part of a series, the other reports published in that series can be presented. An example is provided here:

The final slide must always thank the audience for their attention as shown below:

### 1.3.      Guiding Principles for the Development of PowerPoint Slides

·         Choose contrasting colours for text i.e. – dark text on a light background or vice versa.

·         Use a minimum font size of 28 for text on slides for readability.

·         Do not overload your slides with text. Presenters should aim for a succinct sentence per bullet point and a maximum five bullets per slide. If the slide is overloaded and all that information is necessary, then the text can be spread out over two slides.

·         Avoid lengthy paragraphs and large blocks of text. Paragraphs should be summarised and broken up into bullet points.

·         Where possible use visuals such as diagrams, pictures, and video clips instead of text.

·         Avoid text animations that can be distracting for the audience. If necessary, and can enhance the presentation, use very simple animations such as the appear feature.

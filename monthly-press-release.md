# Monthly press release

As part of efforts to promote the usage of statistics, the Statistical Service has initiated the production of press releases for the commemoration of International Days. The press releases aim to present statistics related to the theme for the international day to help raise awareness of the issue being commemorated. The press releases are primarily for the media to provide public education but can also be used by other stakeholders for advocacy, policy, and planning. As such, they must be written in simple non-technical language.

Content in press releases must be front-loaded, i.e., the most important information for readers should be presented first.

&#x20;

### 1.1.      Format of Monthly Press Releases

Monthly press releases must have the following components:

#### 1.1.1.   Header

The standard header for monthly press releases is provided below.

&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 1.1.2.   Serial number

Press releases should be numbered based on the month and year they are released. CPI and PPI releases will be 01 and 02 respectively for each month so monthly press release numbers must start from 03. The serial number should be right aligned and the month and year italicised. An example is shown below:

#### 1.1.3.   Main title and sub-title

The main title should provide the most striking finding from the statistics presented in the press release. It should be written in simple, non-technical language and as much as possible be less than 10 words. The main title should be written in Century Gothic Size 12 font and bolded.

The sub-title should provide succinct supplementary detail on the information in the press release. The main title should be written in Century Gothic Size 10 font and italicised.

An illustration of the main title and sub-title of a monthly press release is shown below:

1.2 million children in Ghana are currently not attending school

_Ghana Statistical Service shines a spotlight on vulnerable children in Ghana for World Children’s Day_

&#x20;

#### 1.1.4.   Main text of the press release

The statistics should be presented in this section starting with the headline statistics in the main title. This section must be written in simple, non-technical language.

Press releases should aim to provide statistics on five distinct indicators which should be disaggregated by socio-demographic and/or geographic characteristics.

For each paragraph, the main findings should be bolded for emphasis as illustrated below:

Statistics from the 2021 Population and Housing Census reveal that 1,215,546 children of school-going age in Ghana are not attending school. Further, three out of every four (77.4%) of children not in school representing almost a million (942,427) children, have never attended school.

Any indicators that require definitions should be explained in simple language.

Three in every four persons (77.3%) do not primarily rely on clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Clean fuels and technologies for cooking include stoves and cookers using electricity, LPG, natural gas, biogas, solar, alcohol, or ethanol.

The data source of the statistics, the period, and the unit of analysis must be provided to providers with adequate contextual information. If the data is not national, the geographic area must also be specified. An example is provided below:

These statistics are based on 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) data on children for whom vaccination information was recorded from their vaccination cards.

#### 1.1.5.   Supplementary information

Monthly press releases should also provide information on the international day that is being commemorated. An example is shown below:

International Day of Rural Women is commemorated annually on 17th October to promote the implementation of policies and programmes to improve the lives of women in rural areas. The theme for 2023 is "Rural women confront the global cost-of-living crisis".

The main text must conclude with information on where readers can access the data source of the statistics presented in the press release and any other relevant reports published by GSS as illustrated below:

Disaggregated data on women and girls in rural areas can be accessed directly from the [GSS StatsBank](https://statsbank.statsghana.gov.gh/pxweb/en/). The 2022 AHIES Third Quarter Labour Statistics Report can be downloaded from [www.statsghana.gov.gh](http://www.statsghana.gov.gh).&#x20;

The standard text below on GSS must be provided in a separate sub-section on the second page.

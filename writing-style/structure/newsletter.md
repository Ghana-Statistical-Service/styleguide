# Newsletter

## 1.  NEWSLETTERS

Newsletters should accompany routine releases that are not tied to publications such as CPI, PPI, and GDP. The newsletters should present the main highlights of the PowerPoint presentation made to the media and any additional relevant insights.

&#x20;

### 1.1.      Format of Newsletters

Newsletters should include the elements outlined below:

1\.    Cover page – the cover page must have the standard cover design which provides information on the release. Beneath the design, information on the period for which the statistics are being presented.

2\.    Summary – this section must provide three to five succinct takeaways with key statistical highlights. Takeaways must include figures.

3\.    Statistics – the section should present the findings in charts and tables accompanied by brief text explanations.

4\.    Notes/Definitions – this section should provide any additional information required to contextualise the statistics presented in the newsletter. A link to the methodological guide should be provided.

5\.    Contact Information – the email address of the lead person responsible for producing the statistics should be provided.

6\.    Appendices (if applicable) – this section should present disaggregated statistics and historical trends.

&#x20;

Newsletters should be formatted according to font, paragraph and spacing guidelines used for all other publications. Tables and charts should similarly follow the guidelines.

&#x20;

### 1.2.      Length of Newsletters

The recommended length for newsletters is 10 to 15 pages.&#x20;

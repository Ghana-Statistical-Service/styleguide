# Highlights

The purpose of presenting highlights is to point out striking findings and interesting patterns of policy relevance to the reader. Highlights should always be written with the audience in mind.

Highlights should always complement the data visualisation in reports. There should be no highlights without charts and no charts without highlights.

&#x20;

### 1.1.      Guidelines for Writing Highlights

Below are guidelines that authors should adhere to strictly in the construction of highlights. Highlights are not intended just to describe statistics in words. Rather, they aim to point readers to important patterns and trends, particularly those of policy relevance and to add to existing knowledge. Accurate and insightful highlights that are clearly explained and meaningful will support informed decision-making

1\.    Highlights should avoid presenting information that is easily obvious to the reader such as which group is the highest or the lowest. Rather it should provide additional insight on policy-relevant findings in the statistics presented.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The Northern Region (41,754) had the highest number of households where no member used an ICT device in the three months preceding Census Night followed by Ashanti (39,182).</td><td valign="top">The Northern Region (41,754) had the highest number of households where no member used an ICT device in the three months preceding Census Night, followed by Ashanti (39,182). These two regions combined constitute about a fifth of all households where no member used an ICT device.</td></tr></tbody></table>

2\.    Highlights should always aim to present information that is new to the reader.

3\.    Avoid presenting blocks of text as highlights. Aim for three lines or less for each highlight. Unless there is a compelling reason, highlights should not exceed two sentences.

4\.    Highlights should be succinct with no more than 20 words in each sentence.

5\.    The recommended ratio is one highlight to one chart. Two highlights can be used for one chart in cases where the same chart can illustrate multiple highlights. In cases where there are more than two potential highlights, writers must prioritise and select the two most policy-relevant highlights.

6\.    Generally, each highlight should focus on messaging one statistic.

7\.    Phrases such as “it should be noted that”, “the findings reveal”, “the graph indicates”, “the table shows” etc. should be avoided to make sentences as succint as possible.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The population pyramid reveals that there are more youth aged 15 to 35 years in urban (60.5%) than in rural (39.5%) areas.</td><td valign="top">There are more youth aged 15 to 35 years in urban (60.5%) than in rural (39.5%) areas.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The 2021 PHC results indicate that average household size is 3.6 and decreased by one person (0.9) since 2010 (4.5).</td><td valign="top">Average household size is 3.6 and decreased by one person (0.9) since 2010 (4.5).</td></tr></tbody></table>

8\.    Highlights should refer to findings in the chart and should not reference statistics that are not presented e.g., highlights discussing absolute numbers while the chart presents statistics in percentages.

In instances where a chart presents percentages, but the absolute numbers are substantial and need to be highlighted for policy makers, the absolute number can be put into parentheses following the percentage. For example, “About eight percent of the population (representing 2,098,138 persons) have varying degrees of difficulty in performing activities”. This should only be done once within one highlight.

9\.    Highlights should not reference statistics presented in previous charts. Rather any comparisons that need to be made must be presented in the chart accompanying the highlight.

10\.  Highlights should also reference names and categories exactly as presented in the charts so as not to confuse readers: e.g., KMA on the chart should not be referred to as Kumasi Metro in the highlights.

11\.  Highlights presenting ranges should always be presented either from:

a.    The lowest to highest value for the indicator being presented such as “the difference ranges from 3.7 percentage points to 26.5 percentage points”; or

b.    The worst to the best such “In seven regions more than half of children 6 to 14 years did not use an ICT device ranging from 72.8 percent in the Savannah Region to 56.3 percent in Bono East.”

12\.  Highlights must always include numbers referencing the statistics presented in the chart as illustrated below:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">In 2021, there were more persons 15 years and older who did not own a mobile phone than in 2010. The decline in absolute numbers was larger for females compared to males.</td><td valign="top">In 2021, 2.7 million persons 15 years and older did not own a mobile phone. This number represents a decline of 4.6 million from 2010. The decline in absolute numbers was larger for females (2.6 million) compared to males (2.0 million).</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Greater Accra has the highest average monthly net salary while North East has the lowest.</td><td valign="top">Greater Accra has the highest average monthly net salary (GH₵3,142) while North East has the lowest (GH₵2,212).</td></tr></tbody></table>

13\.  For reports to be engaging, highlights should not be monotonous with the same wording repeated within the same or in subsequent highlights.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Four out of five (80.8%) married persons have not registered their marriage. Three out of five (59.9%) married persons have not registered their marriage in the Greater Accra Region, the regions with the highest proportion.</td><td valign="top">Four out of five (80.8%) married persons have not registered their marriage. The proportion is highest in the Greater Accra Region (59.9%) where three out of every five married persons have not registered their marriage.</td></tr></tbody></table>

14\.  When possible, percentages should be approximated in simple language e.g., three in every five (58.7%) or one-quarter (25.2%).

15\.  Highlights should avoid subjective words such as few, many, some, a lot, several etc. A highlight should rather utilise numbers to quantify whatever is being communicated.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A few regions had differences between males and females greater than the national average.</td><td valign="top">Four regions had differences between males and females greater than the national average.</td></tr></tbody></table>

16\.  Highlights should objectively present statistics and avoid subjective qualifiers such as only, too.

17\.  Highlights should refrain from making inferences to explain the observed patterns and focus solely on communicating what is evident in the data presented.

18\.  It should be clear to readers which numbers in the chart the highlight refers to. Readers should not have to make complex calculations to arrive at the numbers stated in the highlight.&#x20;

19\.  As a guiding principle, highlights should not use a short period to tell a trend story. At least a 10-year period is required for a discussion of trends.&#x20;

20\.  Statistics in highlights must be described in objective and scientific language such as recorded, observed, reported, and avoid words such as saw, enjoyed, experienced that are used when referring to people.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The Northern Region saw an increase of 12.5 percentage points between 2010 and 2021.</td><td valign="top">The Northern Region recorded an increase of 12.5 percentage points between 2010 and 2021.</td></tr></tbody></table>

21\.  As with sentences in other sections, highlights should not start with prepositions (of, at, out, on).

&#x20;

### 1.2.      Guiding Questions for Generating Highlights

Below are some guiding questions for analysing tables to produce highlights that are informative and interesting:

a.    What is the national (or regional) figure?&#x20;

b.    Is there a national or international policy target to which the figure can be compared?

·         If yes, is the national or regional figure above or below the target?

·         If yes, how far away from the target is the national/regional figure?

c.    What are the values for the levels of disaggregation (e.g., sex, type of locality, region, or district)?

·         How far are the values of the subgroups from the national average?

d.    Are any sub-groups unusually high or low?

e.    What are the maximum and minimum values within groups?

f.     What is the range between the maximum and minimum?

·         Are there large differences (either in absolute numbers or percentage differences)?

g.    Are there any unexpected values that go against general convention? e.g., females having higher earnings than males.

h.    What is the magnitude of differences between groups or time periods?

Notes:

Always be mindful of sex disaggregation when generating highlights.

It is necessary to review the statistics both row-wise and column-wise and to analyse both the absolute numbers and percentages. This will make it easier to properly identify the interesting patterns.

&#x20;

### 1.3.      Steps for Generating Highlights

The production of highlights should follow the sequence below:

1\.    Analysis of tables to identify patterns and striking findings.

2\.    Development of text highlights succinctly describing the findings from the analysis of the tables in one or two sentences each. The text should be written in simple non-technical language that a diverse audience can understand.

3\.    Creation of charts for each text highlight. Charts should be tailored for the text highlight. Do not try to show everything on one chart but rather focus on communicating one key highlight per chart. For instance, a highlight discussing gender differences at the national level should have be accompanied by a chart that presents gender differences at both the national and regional levels.

Note: Charts should not be generated before the highlights are drafted. This is to ensure that the chart appropriately illustrates the highlight.

&#x20;

### 1.4.      Selecting the Appropriate Statistics to Use in Highlights

The choice of statistics to use in highlights must be strictly determined by the message to be conveyed. Authors are prohibited from selecting statistics that are meant to present misleading information. This section presents guiding principles for selecting the appropriate statistic:

&#x20;

#### 1.4.1.  Percentages

A percentage is a number expressed as a fraction of 100 to represent parts of a whole. Both the numerator and the denominator in a percentage must have the same unit; e.g., the percent of children who are poor: numerator is poor children, and the denominator is children.

Percentages should be used to:

1\.    Present information on the composition of a group e.g. _About two in every three (64.5%) children who are multidimensionally poor live in rural areas_.

_2._    Make comparisons between groups or over time e.g. _The age group 6 to 14 years (44.6%) had the highest percentage that did not use followed by persons 61 years and older (23.9%)._

When computing percentages, it is important to utilise the appropriate numerator and denominator.

For comparison of groups, the denominator must differ for the two groups e.g., when comparing poverty for males and women, the percent of women who are poor must be computed as the number of poor women divided by all women and the percent of men who are poor must be computed as the number of poor men divided by all men. In these cases, the two percentages are not expected to add up 100.

The same denominator must only be used when presenting shares of a group e.g. the sex composition of the population – number of women divided by the total equals what percent of population is female, and the number of men divided by the total population equals what percent of population is male. In this case, the two percentages must add up to 100.

&#x20;

#### 1.4.2.  Percentage points

Percentage points refer to the difference between two percentages. These should only be used to highlight striking differences within groups e.g., _The difference between females and males increases with age: ranging from -3.7 percentage points for those 6 to 14 years to 26.5 percentage points for those 61 years and older._

&#x20;

#### 1.4.3.  Proportions

A proportion is a number expressed as a fraction of one to represent parts of a whole. Proportions should be used for making comparisons between groups or over time. As a rule, percentages should be used instead of proportions as percentages are easier to understand.

&#x20;

#### 1.4.4.  Absolute numbers

Absolute numbers refer to raw totals.

Absolute numbers are best used when exact quantities need to be communicated e.g. _There are 1,215,546 children aged 4 to 17 years in Ghana who are currently not attending school._

When presenting statistics that involve a small sample (i.e. less than 100), absolute numbers should be used such as _three out of the 16 regions_ rather than _18.8 percent of the regions._

In the interest of leaving no one behind, it can be informative to use absolute numbers to highlight populations that are vulnerable e.g., _Nationally, there are 275,562 children with difficulty in performing activities in at least one domain._

When presenting low percentages, absolute numbers can provide additional detail to highlight the magnitude involved for the reader. In this case, the absolute number would be presented alongside the percentages. e.g. _Almost 8 percent of the population (representing 2.1 million persons) have varying degrees of difficulty in performing activities._

Charts with absolute numbers can be presented alongside charts with percentages with the highlight appropriately providing context or a caveat can be added in the introduction as shown below:

Statistics in this report are presented both in percentage and absolute numbers. Absolute numbers are used to highlight geographic areas with the higher populations of married children in line with the Sustainable Development Goal agenda to leave no one behind. The numbers are presented with the caveat that differences in population sizes across geographic area and time.

&#x20;

#### 1.4.5.  Rates

A rate refers to a quantity or frequency measured against another quantity or frequency. Rates are standardised measures that can be used to compare groups or time periods.

Unlike percentages, the two quantities in a rate do not need to be the same unit e.g., infant mortality rate is measured using deaths per 1,000 live births.

If the two units are the same and the denominator is 100, then the interpretation of rates and percentages are the same.

Rates can also be used to measure changes over time, e.g., the inflation rate measures the change in prices between two time periods.

&#x20;

#### 1.4.6.  Ratios

Similar to rates, ratios also measure one quantity against another quantity to express how many times one value is compared to the other. For example, pupil-teacher ratio is the number of pupils for every teacher.

&#x20;

### 1.5.      Requirements for signing off on highlights

Each highlight in reports must answer at least one of the following questions. Authors are to ensure that they use this checklist to review every highlight in their reports before submitting them for review.

Does the highlight:

1\.    Reveal something new?

2\.    Introduce readers to statistics that are interesting or to information that is surprising or unusual?

3\.    Engender discourse or provoke debate?

4\.    Shed light on a topical issue of policy relevance?

5\.    Provide an alternate message to existing knowledge regarding trends, patterns or correlates?

# Writing Overview
<h1>Writing Style</h1>

### 1.1.      Tone

All official documents must maintain a formal tone for professionalism, standards, and institutional credibility.

Below are guidelines for maintaining a formal tone:

·         Avoid slang, colloquialism, and overly casual expressions.

·         Use only complete and grammatically correct sentences.

·         Present statistics in an objective manner that avoid personal opinions or emotional language.

·         Maintain consistent terminology throughout the document.

·         Use formal vocabulary and avoid contractions (e.g., use "do not" instead of "don't").

·         Organize your writing clearly, according to the prescribed structure, with clear headings and subheadings to guide the reader.

·         Write in the third person rather than the first person.

·         Avoid humour and sarcasm.

·         Review, proofread and edit documents meticulously.

&#x20;

### 1.2.      Style and Grammar <a href="#toc185410011" id="toc185410011"></a>

All reports should be written in a formal professional style and be free of grammatical and typographical errors. Writers are encouraged to utilise word processing software or online editing tools to review their drafts before submission.

&#x20;

#### 1.2.1.  Language

GSS produces publications for diverse users including policymakers, civil society organisations, development partners and the private sector. As such reports should be written in clear non-technical language. Writers should use more common words and restrict the usage of jargon to increase the readability of reports. When technical terms are used, they should be properly explained.

Publications released by the Statistical Service are formal documents and should exclude:

·         contractions (e.g., can’t, don’t)

·         shorthand (e.g., &, cont’d)

·         shortened word forms (e.g., org., dept., Dir.)

·         colloquial expressions (e.g., kids, folks, a bunch of, lots of, get rid of)

·         idioms (e.g., deal with, on the flip side, boils down to)

Writers should also avoid the use of local slang such as _dumsor_ (persistent power outages). Local slang can be used when there is no formal alternative but should be italicised for example, _trotro_, or _chop bar_. Where there is a formal but less recognised alternative, the slang can be inserted in parentheses e.g., female porters (_kayayei_).

Reports should be written in the third person and avoid using personal pronouns such as I and we.

&#x20;

#### 1.2.2.  Basic grammar rules

The following basic rules must guide writers when drafting reports:

·         Every sentence must start with a capital letter and end with a full stop or a question mark.

·         Subject and verbs must always agree. Note that words such as each, either, neither, every, require singular verbs. E.g., each region has more than half of its population with some education.

·         Sentences must not start with prepositions (e.g., of, on, at).

·         Sentences must not start with acronyms.

·         The following combinations are the only acceptable ones for paired conjunctions:   either with or; both with and; neither with nor

&#x20;

#### 1.2.3.  Clarity

As much as possible, reports should use the active voice (e.g., the Statistical Service conducted a three-day training for five enumerators) and avoid the passive voice (e.g., five enumerators were trained for three days).

Writers should use specific figures and avoid subjective quantifiers such as many, a few, and most.

Writers should similarly avoid using adverbs such as very, really, and quite as descriptive words and rather use one fitting word; e.g., rapidly (very quickly), sizeable (really large), moderately (quite slowly).

&#x20;

#### 1.2.4.  Length of sentences and paragraphs

While there are no strict limits, writers are advised to average three to five sentences per paragraph.

Similarly, writers are advised to have an average of 12 to 15 words per sentence in their reports. Sentences should not exceed 25 words. Lengthy sentences can be broken up into multiple sentences or converted into a bulleted list.

&#x20;

&#x20;

#### 1.2.5.  Conciseness

Writers should aim for short succinct sentences to avoid verbosity. For instance, “The purpose of the pre-test was to assess the questionnaire” (10 words) can be “The pre-test assessed the questionnaire” (five words).

Phrases should be replaced with single words whenever possible. Some suggestions are provided below:

&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Phrase</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>One word</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>As a consequence of </p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>At all times</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Always</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>At the current time</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Currently, now</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because of the fact that</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Based on the fact that</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Consists of </p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Comprises</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Come across</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Meet, discover, find</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Does not include</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Excludes</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Due to the fact that</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>During the course of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>During </p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Find out whether</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Examine, explore, assess</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>For the purpose of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>For, to</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Have the ability to</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Able to, can</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In efforts to </p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>To</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In light of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Considering</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In spite of the fact that</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Despite, although</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In the absence of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Without</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In the course of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>While, during</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In the event that</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>If</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In order to</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>To</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In the recent past</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Recently</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In view of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Considering</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Look closely at</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Examine, explore, assess</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>On a daily basis</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Daily</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>On a monthly basis</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Monthly</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>On a quarterly basis</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Quarterly</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>On a yearly basis</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Annually</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>On many occasions</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Often</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Once in a while</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Occasionally </p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Some time ago</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Previously</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Takes into account</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Considers</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>The same as</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Equivalent, similar</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>The reason is because</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Because</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>To a large extent</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Largely </p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>With the exception of</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Except</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>With the intention </p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Intends </p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>Within</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p><p>In</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

#### 1.2.1.  Avoiding redundancy

Writers should also avoid redundancy to make sentences succinct. Below are some examples of phrases with redundant words to avoid. They should only be used in the instances where they are technical terms in a specific discipline.

&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Redundancy</td><td valign="top">Succinctness</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A total of 1.2 million persons</td><td valign="top">1.2 million persons</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Absolutely essential</td><td valign="top">Essential</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Absolutely necessary</td><td valign="top">Necessary</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Actual facts</td><td valign="top">Facts</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Add an additional</td><td valign="top">Additional</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Add up</td><td valign="top">Add</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Added bonus</td><td valign="top">Bonus</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ask a question</td><td valign="top">Ask</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Assemble together</td><td valign="top">Assemble</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ATM machine</td><td valign="top">ATM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Attach together</td><td valign="top">Attach</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Basic necessities</td><td valign="top">Necessities</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Blue in colour</td><td valign="top">Blue</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Careful scrutiny</td><td valign="top">Scrutiny</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Collaborate together</td><td valign="top">Collaborate</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Close proximity</td><td valign="top">Proximity</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Connect together</td><td valign="top">Connect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Current status</td><td valign="top">Status</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Drop down</td><td valign="top">Drop</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">During the course of</td><td valign="top">During</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Empty space</td><td valign="top">Space</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">End result</td><td valign="top">Result</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Equal half</td><td valign="top">Half</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Exact same</td><td valign="top">Same</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Exactly the same</td><td valign="top">The same</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Evolve over time</td><td valign="top">Evolve</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Few in number</td><td valign="top">Few</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Foreign imports</td><td valign="top">Foreign</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">General public</td><td valign="top">Public</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Introduce a new</td><td valign="top">Introduce</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Invited guests</td><td valign="top">Guests</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Join together</td><td valign="top">Join</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Knowledgeable experts</td><td valign="top">Experts</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Large in size</td><td valign="top">Large</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Merge together</td><td valign="top">Merge</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">New beginning</td><td valign="top">Beginning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">New innovation</td><td valign="top">New</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Nine different regions</td><td valign="top">Nine regions</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Past history</td><td valign="top">History</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Plan ahead</td><td valign="top">Plan</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Period of seven days</td><td valign="top">Seven days</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Personal opinion</td><td valign="top">Personal</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pick and choose</td><td valign="top">Pick</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PIN number</td><td valign="top">PIN</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Postpone until later</td><td valign="top">Postpone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Reach out to</td><td valign="top">Contact</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Repeat again</td><td valign="top">Repeat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Reply back</td><td valign="top">Reply</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recur again</td><td valign="top">Recur</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Round in shape</td><td valign="top">Round</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rise up</td><td valign="top">Rise</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Small in size</td><td valign="top">Small</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Spell out in detail</td><td valign="top">Spell out</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Still persists</td><td valign="top">Persists</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strictly forbidden</td><td valign="top">Forbidden</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sum total</td><td valign="top">Total</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Unexpected surprise</td><td valign="top">Surprise</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Whether or not</td><td valign="top">Whether</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10 a.m. in the morning</td><td valign="top">10 a.m. or 10 in the morning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">12 noon</td><td valign="top">Noon or 12 p.m.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">15 years of age</td><td valign="top">15 years or aged 15</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

#### 1.2.2.  Tenses

Verb tenses should be consistent throughout. The recommended tenses are presented below:

&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Section</td><td valign="top">Tense</td><td valign="top">Example</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Overview including field operations, and other activities completed before report writing</td><td valign="top">Past</td><td valign="top">GSS developed two categories of instruments for the 2021 PHC: the listing form and the enumeration instruments.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Literature review</td><td valign="top">Present perfect</td><td valign="top">Being behind grade for age has been shown to negatively influence students’ academic and socio-emotional outcomes.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Past</td><td valign="top">Anarfi, Awusabo-Asare, and Nsowah-Nuamah (2000) estimated that there were 500,000 to 800,000 Ghanaians in Côte d’Ivoire in 1986.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Data and methodology</td><td valign="top">Present</td><td valign="top">The statistics presented in this thematic brief are generated from the 2021 PHC and findings on trends are complemented with data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Findings and highlights</td><td valign="top">Present*</td><td valign="top">Three in ten (30.2%) persons 6 years and older are not literate in any language.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Past tense can be used for historical comparisons</td><td valign="top">Urban and rural populations increased in all regions between 2010 and 2021 except Eastern and Ahafo regions where rural population decreased.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Conclusions</td><td valign="top">Present</td><td valign="top">The findings indicate that a substantial share of children is being deprived of their rights as outlined in the 1992 Constitution and the 1998 Children’s Act.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recommendations</td><td valign="top">Present</td><td valign="top">Given the observed protective influence of schooling on girls, it is particularly important for a coordinated effort to ensure that girls start and stay in school.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

\*Note: The use of present tense for findings and highlights is subject to the timely release of a report following the completion of data collection. For reports that are released more than 12 months after data collection, past tense should be used for highlights as that is more appropriate.

#### 1.2.3.  Punctuation

A comma (,) can be used to separate items in a list, or enclose non-essential information.

&#x20;

When a list within a sentence contains three or more items, a comma must be used after all items except the last one as shown below.

&#x20;

This report presents data on literacy, current school attendance, and educational attainment.

&#x20;

Semicolons (;) should be used to separate items in a complex list.

&#x20;

When items in the list contain commas, semicolons should be used to separate items as shown below:

&#x20;

This publication targets Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs); Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs); development partners; civil society organisations (CSOs); private sector; research and academia; and the public.

&#x20;

A period (.) should be used to end all sentences. One space should separate sentences within a paragraph after the period.

&#x20;

Question marks (?) should only be used at the end of a direct question.

&#x20;

Exclamation marks (!) should not be used in official publications as they are used to express strong emotion or surprise. Reports must be written in objective and neutral language.

&#x20;

Colons (:) should be used before a list, explanation, or example.

&#x20;

Apostrophes (') should only be used to show possession. They should not be used to form contractions or with the plural form of acronyms.

&#x20;

Quotation marks ("") should be used to enclose direct speech or information copied verbatim from other sources. Double quotation marks should be used.

&#x20;

A dash (—) can be used before introducing additional information.

&#x20;

Hyphens (-) should be used to join compound words or add prefixes.

&#x20;

&#x20;

#### 1.2.4.  Subject verb agreement of count, noncount and collective nouns

As a rule, always ensure that the subject and verb in a sentence agree in number. An example is illustrated below:

"Nine regions record figures above the national average." (plural subject and verb)

"One region records a rate below 75.0 percent." (singular subject and verb)

&#x20;

Count nouns require singular or plural verbs based on the quantity; e.g., six regions record a percentage above 60.0 percent or one region records a percentage of over 60.0 percent.

&#x20;

Noncount nouns, such as education, research, and information; require singular verbs.

&#x20;

Words that only have a plural form such as earnings, goods require a plural verb.

&#x20;

Institutions are singular e.g., GSS produces quality data.

&#x20;

Data should be considered a collective noun; e.g., the data shows fertility has declined over time.

&#x20;

Statistics should be referred to in the plural; e.g., statistics indicate that fertility has declined over time.

&#x20;

#### 1.2.1.  Prepositions

The following are the prescribed prepositions for words used to present findings:

·         associated with

·         aware of

·         based on

·         capable of

·         characteristic of

·         compared with; compared to

·         composed of; composed by

·         essential to

·         evidence of

·         in comparison with

·         in contrast to; in contrast with

·         involved in

·         lead to

·         necessary for

·         opposed to

·         similar to

·         skilled in; skilled at

·         solution to

·         related to

·         result in

·         use of

&#x20;

#### 1.2.2.  Capitalisation of words

Capital letters should be used for the first words in sentences and for proper nouns. Proper nouns refer to specific persons or places, usually by name. Common nouns, which are general, should not be capitalised. An example is shown below:

&#x20;

We are also indebted to the universities for their technical support, particularly the University of Ghana and the University of Cape Coast. &#x20;

&#x20;

The names of regions in Ghana should be capitalised as such Greater Accra Region. When referring to two or more regions, however, the word regions must not be capitalised. An example is shown below:

&#x20;

The Northern Region (14,031) has the highest number of girls aged 12 to 17 years who have ever been in union, followed distantly by the Ashanti (9,767) and Greater Accra (6,063) regions.

&#x20;

COVID-19 should be capitalised while coronavirus is written in small letters.

&#x20;

### 1.3.      Inclusive Language

Inclusive language is required for all official documents. Inclusive language involves using words and expressions that are free from bias, stereotypes, and discrimination

When using inclusive language, it's important to avoid words and phrases that can be exclusive, biased, or offensive. Below are examples of words and phrases to avoid:

·         Gender-biased words such as chairman, fireman, or policeman. Instead, gender-neutral alternatives i.e. chairperson, firefighter, or police officer should be used.

·         Terms that are not age exclusive such as aged, elderly or senior citizen. Use older adults or specify the age e.g. persons 60 years and older.

·         Words that negatively describe disability such as crippled or handicapped. Instead use persons with disability or persons with difficulty in \[specific condition].

·         Stereotypes or generalisations about certain groups.

·         Terms that may be culturally insensitive or appropriative.

·         Any language that is derogatory or demeaning to any group of people.

&#x20;

### 1.4.      Writing about Numbers

The following guidelines refer to numbers in text, charts, and tables.

&#x20;

All numbers from one to nine should be written in words and those 10 and above should be written in figures in text. Exceptions include age, e.g., persons aged 5 years; and currency, e.g., GH₵8.50; or when approximations are used. e.g., almost 200 persons.

&#x20;

Indicators that refer to persons such as population density (50 persons per square kilometre), or child mortality (21 deaths per 1,000 live births) can also be written without decimal points.

&#x20;

Numbers below 10 must be written in figures in charts and tables.

&#x20;

Ordinal numbers from first to ninth must also be spelt out in text. 10th and above should be written in figures.

&#x20;

Numbers above 999 must be written with commas, e.g., 511,622.

&#x20;

Numbers above 1,000 should be fully written out and abbreviations (such as 1k) should not be used.

&#x20;

Numbers above 1,000,000 should be written in figures and words within text, e.g., 2.5 million.

&#x20;

Sentences beginning with numbers should always have the figures written out in words regardless of whether the number is below or above ten. Numbers above nine must be spelt out if they are the first words in a sentence or approximated so that a word precedes the number in the sentence as shown below:

&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Not acceptable</td><td valign="top">Acceptable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>80.6% of the urban population 6 years and older are literate in at least one language.</p><p> </p></td><td valign="top">Four in five (80.6%) of the urban population 6 years and older are literate in at least one language,</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">230,000 children are engaged in economic activity.</td><td valign="top">Close to 230,000 children are engaged in economic activity.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

When a percentage figure is mentioned in a text, the words ‘percent’ should follow the figure. However, if the figure is quoted in brackets, the percentage symbol (%) should be used. Following is an example:

&#x20;

Among children engaged in economic activity, almost 80 percent are involved in agriculture-related activities with the highest percentage in Savannah (89.8%) and the least in Greater Accra (26.2%).

&#x20;         &#x20;

Fractions (e.g., one-fifth) should be written in words.

&#x20;

Use “to” in text and not hyphens when referring to ranges e.g., 15 to 19 years.

&#x20;

The dates in text should be written as follows: 18th November 2021.

&#x20;

Years should always be written in full in text i.e. 1992, not 92.

&#x20;

### 1.5.      Spelling

Spellings should follow the British convention. Examples are provided below:

&#x20;

Words ending in the following:

·         -se: e.g., organise and analyse

·         -our: e.g., colour and labour

·         -re: e.g., centre and kilometre

·         -il: e.g., fulfil and enrol

·         -sation: e.g., urbanisation

Words containing the following:

·         -mme- e.g., programme

·         -oe- e.g., foetus, diarrhoea

&#x20;

#### 1.5.1.  Compound words

For consistency, writers should follow the conventions below for the following compound words:

·        Baseline

·         Coordinate

·         Coordinator

·         Cooperate

·         Cooperation

·         Dataset

·         Database

·         Decision-maker

·         Decision-making

·        Email

·        Endline

·        Fieldwork

·        In depth

·        Intercensal

·        Long-term

·        Low-income

·         Metadata

·         Multidimensional

·         Multidisciplinary

### 1.6.      Use of Abbreviations and Acronyms

All abbreviations and acronyms in reports must be fully spelled out when first mentioned and the abbreviation provided in brackets.

Abbreviations should be written without full stops and spaces in between letters, e.g., CAPI.

Abbreviated measurements (such as km, and kg) are acceptable. When using abbreviated measures, there should be no space between the number and measure, e.g., 50km.

When using the acronym form of GSS, a definite article should not be used: i.e., GSS produces census and survey reports per its mandates.

Acronyms in the plural should not be written with apostrophes; e.g., this publication targets MDAs and MMDAs.

Abbreviations for a year’s quarters should be written as follows Q# Year e.g. Q3 2023.

&#x20;

### 1.7.      Use of Parentheses

Parentheses must be used to include additional information.

&#x20;

As a rule, use round brackets.

&#x20;

However, parentheses within parentheses must be avoided. Square brackets should be used with round brackets to create a double enclosure in the text: e.g., international development agendas (such as the Sustainable Development Goals \[SDGs]).

&#x20;

Parentheses next to parentheses must also be avoided. Square brackets should be used next to parentheses (round brackets): e.g., a third of the population (32.7%) \[Figure 1].

&#x20;

### 1.8.      Use of Symbols

Avoid the use of symbols in place of words within text.&#x20;

·         Use ‘to’ and not hyphens (-): e.g., 15 to 19 years.

·         Use ‘or’ and not slash (/): e.g., borehole or tube well

·         Use ‘and’ not ampersands (&): e.g. mining and quarrying

·         Use greater than or less than and not > or <

&#x20;

### 1.9.      References

Publications from GSS should utilise the [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references) (APA) style of referencing.

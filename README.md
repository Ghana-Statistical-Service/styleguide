# Welcome

The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) produces reports based on censuses, surveys, administrative and non-traditional data sources per its mandates to provide comprehensive, reliable, quality, relevant, accurate and timely statistical information to guide national development as stipulated in Section 3 of the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003).

This document is a guide for staff and collaborators who analyse data and produce reports and other publications for the Statistical Service. The purpose of the style guide is to establish a consistent and professional approach to all written communications produced by GSS. It serves as a comprehensive reference for staff, ensuring that documents, reports, and other materials adhere to a unified standard of clarity, accuracy, and readability.

The contents include instructions on design, formatting, writing style, communicating findings, and data visualisation. It provides information on the format, target audience, and purpose of the different types of publications produced by GSS. By providing clear guidelines in these areas, the style guide helps maintain the credibility and reliability of the office's publications. It also facilitates effective communication with diverse audiences, including policymakers, researchers, and the public, by promoting the use of plain language and accessible formats. Ultimately, the style guide supports the Serviceâ€™s mission to deliver high-quality statistical information that informs decision-making and contributes to national development.

The guide sets out a distinct style for communicating and disseminating statistics from GSS. Consistency in communication is crucial for maintaining clarity, building trust, and ensuring that messages are understood as intended. When communication is consistent, it helps to reinforce the organization's identity and values, making it easier for stakeholders to recognise and relate to the brand. Consistent use of terminology, tone, and style across all communication channels prevents misunderstandings and confusion, ensuring that the information is conveyed accurately and effectively. Moreover, it enhances the professional image of the organization, fostering credibility and reliability. By adhering to established guidelines and standards, the institution can create a cohesive and unified voice that resonates with their audience and supports their overall objectives.

Adherence to the style guidelines is thus necessary for delivering the mandate of the Service and achieving the vision of being the trusted provider of official statistics.

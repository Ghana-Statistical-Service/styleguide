# Factsheet

The purpose of fact sheets is to present key statistics on indicators of policy relevance that can be easily referenced for decision-making. The target audience for these fact sheets is policy makers, civil society organisations, and development partners.

Fact sheets can be used to provide timely statistics on specific indicators ahead of the release of a report, supplementary statistics of relevance not included in reports, or rapid response to a request from policy makers or other key data users.
